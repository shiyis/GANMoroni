## GANMoroni or The Great Angel Moroni project breakdown

According to the Prophet Joseph Smith from the LDS (or the Church of Jesus Christ of Later Day Saints), angel moroni was the guardian of the golden plates buried near his home in western New York, 
which Latter Day Saints believe were the source of the Book of Mormon. An important figure in the theology of the Latter Day Saint movement, Moroni is featured prominently in its architecture and art.

Emblematic of the great creative power of JC our savior and heavenly father, I created this project - a play-on-words - that utilitizes the generative adversarial network to forge an image of prophetic faces that resemble the almighty power and spiritual embodiment. 
So please bear with me here, as I walk you through the generalities of the deep learning model, which is quite uncanny that kind of does what the great angel Moroni strives to represent, which is the symbol of art and architecture.
